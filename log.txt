Tue Aug 29 2017 18:55:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@193784171632525314> so im starting again.

Tue Aug 29 2017 19:29:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i do that often
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:29:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> many times it's easier to just scrap everything
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:32:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> C++ is pretty much confusing. First they say that reference acts like an alias to a variable ```Cpp
 int v = 1;
int &r = v;```
Then they come and blast an example with a constant without explaining anything.```Cpp
const int &r = 1;```
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:33:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> and that 1 is totally a literal and not an object.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:37:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yeah, const is a thing
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:38:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you can't change `r`, so it might as well be that `1`
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:38:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> True, but isn't the whole idea of referencing is being an alias to a variable? I can just simple use `const int r = 1`; It's the same thing right?
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:39:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:40:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> here's a good answer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10801894/const-reference-can-be-assigned-an-int
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:40:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Not sure how people code in C++. I encountered top/low level const and it's pretty much complicated :P
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:40:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Can't imagine how they use them in practical code. One of the weakness of the book I am reading now.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:41:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> most people use only a subset in their whole time with c++
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:41:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Ah, so it's like vim. You only use what you think is best for you.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:41:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i have yet to hear someone that has used the full language
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:41:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You can do something in many ways, but you decide on what suites you.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:42:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I will just go through this 1.4k and go do something with it to make it stick in my head.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:42:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i just use C, got around it in one day
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:42:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well C is fun to work with, but it's time consuming.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:43:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> not reall
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:43:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's fun an i like coding with it
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:44:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Yeah I know. I just think that focusing on C++ is better for my future as a game developer.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:44:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's time consuming if you try to only use the bare bones of C
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:44:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'd say c# rather
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:44:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> unity has the biggest share
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:45:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> what do you mean by biggest share?
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:45:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's the most popular engine
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:45:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> As in job offers?
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:45:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> overall
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:45:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> including job offers
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:46:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nearly all posts in GDL in #paid-work want a Unity programmer
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:47:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well it's not really *game developing* that I am going with. It's more like making engines or something like that. I will be able to make systems and went through worst ordeals than that of using unity.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:47:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> sooo making engines
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:47:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Yep.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:47:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> people don't buy engines
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:47:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i thought you needed a job <:blobthonkang:293808597522055168>
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:47:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> People will still make their own engines.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:48:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am going to get hired for a startup that's gonna make a 3D builder using 3js webgl. with physics engine and virtual reality.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:48:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> That's gonna help me a lot.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:48:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I already rejected a unity job offer.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:48:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but that js
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:49:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Still though. I am gonna learn webgl which is similar to opengl.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:49:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but it's JS
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:49:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> This is why I am learning C++ <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>

Tue Aug 29 2017 19:49:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> The concepts would be the same.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:50:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i mean, it won't be quite the same
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:50:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> cameras, collision detection, glsl
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:50:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's still gonna help me though.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:50:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> opengl provides none of them only glsl
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:51:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> opengl is just a rendering API
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:51:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Like webgl?
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:51:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it lets you draw stuff on the screen with the gpu
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:51:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I know that?
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:51:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am saying that I am gonna deal with cameras and collision detection.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:52:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> even if I am gonna use js, the concepts can be migrated to C++.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:52:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but yknow, there's a wrapper and then there's the API, because it looks like webgl is object oriented
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:53:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it won't be really transferrable to the raw opengl API
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:53:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I didn't mean the code. I mean the ideas. I will write it from scratch.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:54:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> even so, the ideas depend on the wrapper
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:54:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> <:FatThunk:325807830487531522> makes sense, but I do believe there are similarities.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:55:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you should learn OpenGLES 2.0 and 3.0 then
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:55:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> because that's the api they are roughly following with webgl
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:56:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> GLES is for embedded/mobile devices, and thus is quite the subset
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:56:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you won't get the full opengl
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:56:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I see. I am focusing on C++ for the time being. I am gonna read go4 after that also. I got a long way.
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:59:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Can I conclude that you are gonna use unity?
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:59:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <:blobthonkang:293808597522055168>
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:59:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'm not
Tue Aug 29 2017 19:59:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> what makes you think that
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:01:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You boasted that it was the best path for game development. nevermind.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:01:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'm just telling what i see around
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:01:45 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's not related to what i'm thinking or my plans
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:02:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You said that you wanted to make a game like 2nd life but different in some ways.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:02:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You would write your own engine for that?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:02:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> want != will
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:03:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's an idea, i have no plan to realise it anytime soon
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:03:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> But if you did, what would you use?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:03:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> most likely write my own engine
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You mean engines*?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> the idea just requires a lot of custom things most general engines don't provide
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> That's gonna take a hella of a time.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> no engine
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> one engine
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> for everything?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:04:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i don't understand what you are getting at
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:05:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I thought that people separate tasks for stuff like physics, rendering, AI, etc..?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:05:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They put it one one engine? or they make each one its own engine?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:05:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <:blobconfused:280619952761995267>
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:05:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> an engine consists of systems
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:05:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> all of what you named are systems
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:06:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> not separate engine
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:06:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> huh, I see.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:06:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> wouldn't it be better to make it's own thing so that you can reuse?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:06:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> that would be absurd to have them as independant engines
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:06:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's impossible to have perfect separation between those systems
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:07:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> they are definitely reusable however
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:07:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but they are not separatable
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:07:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They have to interact, but you don't need to make each one know of the other.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:07:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> also even if you could perfectly separate them, it would be a performance hit
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:07:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> perfect encapsulation hurts performance
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:08:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, refactoring != performane.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:08:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> uhhh
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:08:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> refactoring is restructuring code
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:08:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I guess I used the wrong word.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:08:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Maybe *clean*?

Tue Aug 29 2017 20:09:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> still makes no sense
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:09:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I mean. I saw someone refactoring a function where he had to do a while loop 3 times instead of once because it makes it cleaner.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it really depends
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> like he had to go through a list 3 times to do 3 different tasks.

Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there is no one way to refactor things
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> eyyy, you are welcome 😃
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> sololearn is great indeed
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Of course, it depends on the future changes.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:10:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <@78865175251255296> python is a really fun language to learn
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> haha
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> advertising much?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but it is 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> But you are using C nowadays 😏
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@78865175251255296> anyhoo... back to learning 😉  <@!212675363799564289> well... "Fun" is an interesting word. 😉  For us old people, it's pretty much akin to smashing your head on the keyboard.  But yeah...
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 😄
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You are migrating to C right?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:11:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "migrating"
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> most of the times it's an immediate switch
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You got bored of python, right?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> you went to lua and now C?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> ye
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> what's next assembly? 😄
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I won't be surprised.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:12:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i mean, you wouldn't be far off indeed
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:13:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i might attempt to create an OS sometime in the future
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:13:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I bet you will start making your own hardware next few years.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:13:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nah
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:13:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I mean, you might get bored of just using abstract stuff.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:13:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You want to touch something.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> creating hardware needs money and a lot more time to be interesting 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i can simulate it anyway
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> circuit simulation
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> The real thing is different.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> the real thing needs money 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and it's rather boring
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:14:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Then get a job. You are more experienced than me and look I am getting a job here and there.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:15:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you don't have the freedom like in software
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:15:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "look i am getting a job at 24, why aren't you getting a job you underage teen"
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:15:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am 23.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:15:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> meh
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:15:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> everyone's 12 to me
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:15:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> unless stated otherwise
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:16:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> My point is that you are capable.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:16:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> How about doing it?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:16:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You can earn some money then make a startup
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:16:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am very sure that you hate to get bossed around, right?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:16:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> of course i'm capable, i'm just legally bound
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:16:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i won't make a startup though
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:17:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Aren't you the type who doesn't like to get orders from others?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:17:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i have mental issues as it is, i don't need a massive debt on top of it 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:17:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> What do you mean by a dept?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:17:46 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> majority of startups fail and go in debt
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:18:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Did you read that somewhere?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:18:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> This is the era of startups.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:18:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well, will see how yours succeeds
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:18:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I will be the first developer there.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:19:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'll take stable income in an established organisation in the meantime
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:19:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> good, then you'll be the lead
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:19:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> gonna be fun
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:19:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I guess. How about working for a startup then? It won't get you any harm, you will just gain experience.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:19:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you'll get a closeup to it succeeding, or most likely bankrupting
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:20:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Working in a startup would give you more experience than that in a big company.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:20:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@290252124451897344> what
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:20:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'm looking for stable income not a fable 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:20:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> fable? isn't that a game?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:21:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> not sure how fable comes in here <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:21:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's also a synonym for a tale
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:21:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> aka a fictional story
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:21:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I know, but how that can be plugged in there.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:22:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i don't need some dream startup, i want solid income i can rely on to kickstart my life
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:22:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> of course it won't be as fun
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:22:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You can go to other companies after that one fails.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:22:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but i won't have to frantically look for a job when suddenly the startup fails
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:24:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Is it really that hard to get a job in programming? Here, people are dying to hire one. The startup that I am gonna work with is searching for devs since 4< months.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:24:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> are you trying to recruit me for *your* startup 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:24:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I wonder if that can work <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:24:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> not really
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:24:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I know.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:24:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> it's not *mine*.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:25:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> startups are like schrodingers cat, you don't know it's dead until the end
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:25:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well you are the first and only developer there
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:25:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you are half of it technically
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:25:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> If it's not your box, then what's wrong with the wait? I can get a job in 2 weeks max after the startup fails.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:25:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it makes no sense to have a hierarchy between 2 people
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:26:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> There are other 4 people I guess maybe?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:26:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> what are the 4 others
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:26:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am not really well versed with the positions in a company though <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:26:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> one Secretary?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:27:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I hear CTO CEO I don't know
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:27:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> just some fancy words
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:27:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> there are no managers also 😄
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:27:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> are there any other development related people
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:28:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> well there was one guy who worked as a freelancer and took the developer position for 1 month and quit. He's gonna teach me how he works I guess.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:28:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> he didn't quit. It's just a 1 month contract.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:28:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well, actual employees
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:28:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> not contractees
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:28:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> nope. I wonder if they are just too lazy to search for people or it's just that no body is intereseted.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:29:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> so you are the singlemost developer and there's 4 other people that aren't developers
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:29:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You see. I graduated from a bootcamp and got 3-4 offers after that.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:29:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> People are really desperate for devs.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:29:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> There are other 7 who got a job too on the spot.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:30:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> your startup sounds fun
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:30:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> everyone who graduated from there got a job.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:30:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I hope that I am gonna make it. I am gonna start with 900$ for 3 months (Probation), and then if I get accepted the salary will change.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:31:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I guess I could have asked for more, but I don't care about money.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:31:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i suggest you save up 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:31:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> save up?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:31:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> can never be too careful
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:31:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i mean, your startup has one developer and 4 people in management
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:31:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Ah, well from my past job I got 3 months 1.6k$
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:32:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I should have asked for 1.6k <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:32:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'd save up if i was just, just in case they happen to not hire someone else
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:32:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> because without developers it will quite quickly sink
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:32:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> ah I see.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:33:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I hope we will get more devs soon.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:33:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> but I doubt it. They asked me for an interview before 3-4 moths and I refused
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:33:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Because I didn't like webgl. This change of heart 😄
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:34:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i wonder why
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:34:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I wanted a unity job and when I got it I refused it.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:34:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> maybe you got hungry 😛
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:34:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> hungry? what do you mean?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:35:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:35:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Oh, you mean. That I am  desperately looking for a job?
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:36:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> ye
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:36:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> No no. I could have went with a job 1.45k < but I didn't want to.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:36:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> why not
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:37:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, I don't think it's fun. They are working on a medical product.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:37:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They do have many teams, but I think that this startup is someone that I want to work at.
Tue Aug 29 2017 20:37:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> they got backend, frontend, autoamtion, interface, ios, ui, devices?, etc...

Tue Aug 29 2017 21:27:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> You have a prefix command that gets triggered by writting the prefix

Tue Aug 29 2017 21:27:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@193784171632525314> oh yeah lol didn't think of that xD
Tue Aug 29 2017 21:28:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> So what's the point of making a prefix command if you need the prefix to call it

Wed Aug 30 2017 11:47:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes, that's why i said GLES3.0

Wed Aug 30 2017 12:02:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and it's not just "devs use it in  a bad way" they fucking spread that garbage technology
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:02:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> What can you do? You can't just call the web cops.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:02:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> the net is becoming bloated and slow
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:03:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i mean i could start my own network <:blobthonkang:293808597522055168>
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:03:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's not that difficult
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:03:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> needs money though
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:03:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Interesting. Let's see how that will end up. Let's see if it can rival Linus.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:04:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> in a couple years when devices and storage get even smaller and faster i might literally do just that
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:04:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> just start my own network
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:04:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> smaller?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:04:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I thought it get bigger by time <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:05:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> physically
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:05:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I doubt it will get smaller than this.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:05:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i can get a full blown computer the size of two fingers
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:05:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> How can the user interact with it if it's smaller than this?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:05:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it will get smaller
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> There's a difference between *it can* and *it will*.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'll just carry my own network with me
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> if it can, it will most likely
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Oh, ah okay.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and it still can get smaller
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You are gonna put it in your brain 😄
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:06:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nah
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:07:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i ain't that stupid
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:07:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I wonder if someone really plants stuff in their brains.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:08:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> sure cybernetics sound fun, but if it communicates with the outside world, it can and will be compromised at some point
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:09:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I wonder how technology will evolve in the next century.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:09:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> we'll colonise a planet soon enough
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:09:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i doubt it will take a century
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:10:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You are watching too much anime, or maybe you are just playing spore a lot.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:10:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 🤔
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:11:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> unlike some people who think space is a pipedream, i do think we aren't far off from reaching and colonising something like mars or venus
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:12:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> venus most likely
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:12:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Are you following this stuff regularly?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:12:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nah
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:12:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it's far enough that i don't need to check on it daily
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:12:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> So what's your base?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:13:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus#Advantages
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:13:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i'm too lazy to search for the original article
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:13:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> so here's a wiki page
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:13:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Damn, there's a wiki page for everything these days.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:14:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Even if it's possible. Is there anyone is planning to do it?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:15:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well, sadly not venus
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:15:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but musk is working towards mars
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:16:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> sadly? are you saying that you know better than them?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:16:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <:blobglare:294930700879003648>
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:17:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> no, but the conditions on venus are much closer to earth
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:17:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and we could create structures in the upper layer of the atmosphere
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:17:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I mean, there should be a reason for them to pick mars on venus, right?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:17:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there is, mainly because everyone's been neglecting venus in terms of research
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:18:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> we have been sending rovers to mars and researching it way more
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:19:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I wonder if earth is gonna hold up to that day.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:19:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> oh, earth totally will
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:20:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> The only thing we can do is imagine. We ain't gonna live that long.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:21:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> why not
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:21:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> we survived black death
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:21:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> black death?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:21:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <:blobthonkang:293808597522055168>
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:22:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Do you think that you will get to see that happening in your life time?
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:22:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> how do you not know, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:22:45 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> that's pretty scary.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:23:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> humans are persistent
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:24:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i do think i'll see if not colonisation, but atleast a successfull manned flight
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:25:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> More people should work for NASA.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:25:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I wonder what's the chance for the one to think about working for NASA.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:26:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> a decent
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:26:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> though you won't get in there without good education
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:27:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it isn't just random programming where you can get in with experience
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:27:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I know. It's more about the business logic that they use there.
Wed Aug 30 2017 12:29:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <:blobglare:294930700879003648> i mean i wouldn't let some kind of teenager with poor understanding of physics at rockets
Wed Aug 30 2017 13:20:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's just that it's not a popular domain that universities teach world wide.
Wed Aug 30 2017 13:39:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@295038149674139650> what
Wed Aug 30 2017 13:39:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@295038149674139650> what

Wed Aug 30 2017 13:53:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> what isn't a popular domain
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:10:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Whatever you need to get hired by NASA?
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:10:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't know. Rocket science?
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:11:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yknow that nasa encompasses a broad spectrum of science
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:11:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and most of the domains are available in most of the world
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:11:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and it's not just science
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:12:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there's a lot of areas of work there
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:12:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You are right.
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:12:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's that my head was focusing on stuff that's not that popular world wide.
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:12:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> physics, biology, geology, IT, engineering, robotics, etc etc
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:13:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there's actually a bunch of stuff that's been created by NASA that we now use like any other commodity
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:14:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Like what?
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:14:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> like these things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:14:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Oh well, you ain't seeing people asking who invented the internet or the cars. They just use em.
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:16:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Interesting. I wonder why I never heard people trying to go for NASA, instead they go for google. Not sure if it's just too hard to get there or it's just another reason.
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:17:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> as if they are any different
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:17:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> or one's "better"
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:18:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> better? in what sense?
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:18:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> no i mean they just do different things
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:19:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nasa is more hardware/engineering oriented afaik
Wed Aug 30 2017 14:19:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Ah.

Wed Aug 30 2017 18:46:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> The startup is asking me to do some simple tasks like collision detection to check my skills. I am thinking of checking each element with the others each time I render the canvas. Not sure if that's how I should do it though.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:46:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> hahah you are on your own there ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:47:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 100% your thing now
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:47:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I know that, but you can gimme some advises here and there if you want.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:47:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nope
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:47:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> they are evaluating you not me
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:48:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, you know. When you want to solve a problem, you go and check google and ask others for insight.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:48:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's not really cheating or anything.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:48:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i don't even give hints to others on tests
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:49:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's not a test. They already told me that I got the job.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:49:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They just want to know where to start with me.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:49:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> `asking me to do some simple tasks like collision detection to check my skills`
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:49:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you are still under evaluation 😛
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:50:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> what do you mean? Under evaluation for what? They said that I am gonna get the job if I did it or not.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:50:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's not like I don't have a solution for the problem, I just want to see if there's a better one.

Wed Aug 30 2017 18:51:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I bet you don't have a better solution.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:51:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> of course i don't
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:52:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i don't keep baked solutions in my head
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:52:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Oh, so you already read about physics engines?
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:52:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i do fast prototyping and iterate quickly on previous attempts
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:52:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i don't try to get it right the first time
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:53:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> that's why i don't know the "actual solutions"
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:53:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but i can figure them out rather quickly
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:53:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Even if you get it right, you can't prove that your solution is good enough
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:53:46 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i don't have to
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:53:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i improve it continuously
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:54:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> first iteration is a crude prototype that fulfills its purpose
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:54:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> then i iterate again and again
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:54:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> optimizing, cleaning, refactoring
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:54:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> sometimes even rewriting from scratch
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:54:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> That's a way.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:55:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i am independant of baked solutions this way, i figure out them on my own and trust me, that sticks in your head far better
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:55:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I know that from experience.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:56:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> because your brain actually did the work to achieve the goal
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:56:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, your way of thinking falls a little bit. It's like reinventing the wheel at some cases.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:57:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> is that a problem?
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:57:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It depends on your purpose.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:57:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you say like it's a bad thing
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:57:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well if you spend more time on one thing, then you ain't gonna spend it on another thing.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:58:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but then there's you, knowing only one framework that's doing things a certain way, and then there's me knowing the base principles and able to adapt to any framework or roll my own
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:59:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it kinda seems odd to me that everyone's so against reinventing the wheel
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:59:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am not saying that it's always bad. It depends on your case.
Wed Aug 30 2017 18:59:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> reinventing the wheel actually gives you far more insight into it all
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:00:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and really, nothing in programming is "the wheel"
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:00:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Yeah, reinventing the wheel is seen as a bad thing because it's not helping the community.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:00:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there is literally no good way to do anything, all the ways are shitty
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:00:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's just a source of practice.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:00:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "not helping the community", eh i have an inside joke on this one
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:00:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> on another server
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:01:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well there's no perfect way of doing anything.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:01:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> in programming there are no wheels
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:01:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> How about design patterns?
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:01:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> everything's inherently garbage
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:01:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> even patterns, they are applicable in a small amount of cases on very specific structures of code
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:03:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you know that cpus/bios to keep backwards compatability have like 50yo garbage in them
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:04:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> like the first thing you read on something like the OSDEV wiki, it's bringing up super legacy steps you have to go through to get to modern days
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:04:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you don't start at 64 bits, you start at like 8
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:04:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> If you what you are saying is relevant then why applicants go study thousands of *algorithms* just to get accepted by google?
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:05:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes, algorithms, not code
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:05:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> algorithms are plain logic
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:05:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there's no code involved whatsoever
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:05:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but even so
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:05:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you can learn theory, but as i've said previously, it's useless if you can't apply it practically
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:06:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> algorithms many times differ from actual code in many ways
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:06:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> hell, game math is a lot different from the actual real world counterpart
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:06:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, why would someone talk about something that can't be used in practice?
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:06:46 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> even if it's using the same principles
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:06:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> What's the benefit of such thing?
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:06:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> what do you mean by that
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:07:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> ` why would someone talk about something that can't be used in practice`?
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:07:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I mean the theory that can't apply it practically.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:07:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> What's the purpose of such thing then?
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:08:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 🤔 none
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:08:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but yknow i don't think the applicants just go read hundreds of algorithms
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:08:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> google isn't looking for that
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:08:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> google is looking for innovators and people who can come up with solutions on their own
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:09:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> sure the algorithms help, but in the end it's what you can produce on your own
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:09:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, it does enlighten you in some way.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:09:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's like reading many articles before you writing your own.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:10:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> But still, it's far from that. Reading and understanding a solution is way different than solving it.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:10:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's like seeing the solution after failing an exam.
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:11:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> *Oh it was that easy?, pffft, I will ace the next exam*
Wed Aug 30 2017 19:11:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 20/20 hindsight

Wed Aug 30 2017 20:52:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Oh wait, it's resent 😄
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:53:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> oh this one
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:54:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there's a ton of channels like this that have spawned from khanacademy
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:54:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Students should quit schools.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:55:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:55:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> not quit per se
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:55:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but it's certainly possible to learn everything from online courses/classes
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:55:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't see schools as a source of learning. It's more about forcing most kids to do something that they don't like.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:55:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> however human interaction is better for the learning process
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:56:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> human interaction? I was in school, and all the interactions that I have seen was bullshit and artificial that ended after graduation.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:56:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "artificial"
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:56:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you think a 6-7yo kid will learn how to read sitting at a pc
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:57:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You can teach your kid these stuff.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:57:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Or get someone who you trust to do it.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:57:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes, the school
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:57:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Making him interact with other kids is pretty dangerous.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Humans are influenced pretty easily.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Especially at the early age.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> humans are inherently social
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and creative
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> that's the point
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> There's something called home schooled.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:58:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you wouldn't learn at all if you weren't influencable
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> home schooling costs way more
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and isn't standartized
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> But I think it's way more beneficial.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You don't know what's happening at school.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes i do
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> and the education is targeted to all the students not to a certain one.
Wed Aug 30 2017 20:59:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> they are bound by law to tell me what's happening if i ask
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:00:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't mean it like that. At this age, you rarely find an educator.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:00:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> tell me how you plan to educate billions of kids individually
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:00:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They all are in it for the money.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:00:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> no
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:00:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> tell me your plan to educate billions of kids individually
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:00:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> If not, I wouldn't hear people complaining about school all the time.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:01:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> tell me your plan to educate billions of kids individually
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:01:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I think we should start with the sytem itself.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:01:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's not that easy to do something like that.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:01:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you do realise that most of the world's population would have to be just teachers to homeschool every child
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:01:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's gonna do quite a huge impact to life itself.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:02:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> so you think those years you have spent in school are meaningless, and you have learned nothing
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:02:44 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, honestly? I think I am the one to blame for that. I was just a brat who didn't like to study.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:02:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but even so
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:03:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> But, when I encountered a teacher who taught me biology in a fun way and I did a brilliant job, so I think if the others were like him, my future would have changed significantly.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:03:45 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you know how to read, write more or less grammatically correctly, you know a bit from various topics on the world like biology, physics, history, art, languages, psychology, etc
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:04:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> schools also don't exclusively occupy the whole of your time
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:04:46 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't think that the amount of knowledge that I currently have is worth 23 years.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:05:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it depends on the school, but you *have learned* something
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:05:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It does occupy most of your time at young age.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:05:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> At university, it depends.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:05:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it occupies maybe 1/4th up to 1/3rd
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:05:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> that's per week
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:05:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It depends on the student himself.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:06:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and you have holidays
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:06:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> and his teachers.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:06:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and summer vacation
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:06:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you do get quite a bit of free time after school typically
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:06:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, at summer you do have some free time.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:07:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> but before graduation, you barely have any time for yourself.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:08:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and you are in your late teens at that point
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:08:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you spend a lot of time on activities dont you at that point 😬
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:08:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> activities?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:08:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well, going out, playing games, etc etc
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:09:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well it depends if you want to get a scholarship or not.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:09:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> also it's no surprise that before graduation you have less time
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:09:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You are near graduation, right?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you are fully aware of it years ahead
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes i am
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> How's it?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well, will see
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> summer ends in 2 days
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Damn, is it your last year?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> yes
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:10:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i just care about finishing it, not getting good marks or anything
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:11:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, these good marks won't help you much in your career.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:11:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> depends
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:11:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I even forgot about them when I started working.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:11:45 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> in a typical job they don't matter much
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:12:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well in most cases, it doesn't matter.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:12:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but in a specialty they will matter, for degrees
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:13:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Didn't we debate about how degrees are important at some point?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:13:28 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:13:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I thought that it didn't matter, but you thought it did? I don't know, but I remember something like that.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:13:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I start the first day in 26 days
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:13:46 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> <:CenterEyes:230071778645508096>
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:14:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> i feel like this year is going to be rather messy and odd
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:14:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> What do you think about making education where students specialize at a certain craft at young age?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:14:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> dumb
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:14:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> ^
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:14:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Why do you think so?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you'll just fuck the kid up beyond repair
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Because children are undecise
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you'll have to throw it in the trash
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> How would the kid get broken?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> They're too young to make important decisions and the parents shouldn't decide it
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> mentally, how else
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> kids don't cope well with being specialised early
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:15:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> As it's the kid's future
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am just saying that it's better to ignore some stuff and focus on something specific.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> If you ever go outside, Yasser
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> also you'd make the kid miss a lot of other important things
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Ideally they should have fun with their friends
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Playing football or whatever in the street
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> other important? I did study chemistry and biology, but I barely remeber anything now as a developer.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:41 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well, give me an example of how you imagine that specialisation to be carried out
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> start at age 6
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:16:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> that's the typical enrollment age
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:17:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, I wouldn't start at that age.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:17:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Start coding at age 6
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:17:07 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Maybe at 12.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:17:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That'll fill you out of frustration
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:17:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> no, you start going to school at 6
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:17:49 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> how would you do it
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 12 years of standard level education
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Yasser, when I was 6 years old, me and most of my classmates wanted to be school teachers
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, first the kid should get exposed in an intelligent way of how the world works.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> 6 years later, each one wanted different things
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "in an intelligent way"
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And nowadays, they want another things
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> kid aint got no concept of that
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:18:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> your kid barely reads and writes
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:19:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't know man. I am not an educator, but I believe that a lot of the information that you get at school will be wasted.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:19:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> and has no concept of anything but basic things
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:19:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Like one of my classmates wanted to be a scientific/physician, now he just wants to work managing money
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:19:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> If he knows what he wants to be at young age, then that would affect him, his environment and the world positively.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:20:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> When I was 12 years old, I wanted to be a designer
Nowadays I prefer coding
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:20:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Even with 12 years old, kids and teens are still undecisive
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:21:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> if you start specialising early, you'll create inept people who are only able to do only one thing, until they get bored of it very early on, and you'd have wasted that persons whole life
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:21:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> they are kids
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:21:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Ask 10 12-yo teens for 6 years what they want to do for their future, you'll get different replies
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:21:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Kid at this age aren't passionate, they get broken by school.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:21:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> they will change their mind, but their change of mind won't be possible since you've trained them to be one and one thing only
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:21:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> your plan sounds worse than school
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:22:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Yasser
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:22:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, let me ask you one thing. What's the purpose of teaching something that he's not gonna use in his life?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:22:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Kids should have at least an idea of maths, for example
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:22:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well math is another thing.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:22:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Think biology, chemistry, etc...
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> math is not an exception
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:11 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> There are too many people that with the superbasic math equation, "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1*0" they reply 0, when it's 10.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> TOO MANY.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> a musician doesn't need math
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That's fucking basic maths
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It is, and physics also. I believe that these topics are nessacry in most topics.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> `What's the purpose of teaching something that he's not gonna use in his life?` how do you know they won't
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It depends on what you want to specialize at.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:23:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Yasser
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That's why you take the University
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, for instance biology. The chances that you are gonna use that is pretty much slim.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> To specialize in what you want to do
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well when you reach university it's game over for you.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "pretty much slim" because anatomy doesn't matter in an emergency does it
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Game over?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> what? I didn't really learn about stuff like that in school.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:24:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Excuse me
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> The life isn't easy
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you didn't learn anatomy, r u serious
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:14 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Either effort to make your life much greater
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Or get rekt and end in the street asking people for money so you can afford a meal
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't know what you mean by that. I just didn't learn anything that would help me when there's an emergency.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Life's rules
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> a lot of things can help you in an emergency
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:25:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It would be more helpful if they taught me how to react when someone is having a heart attach.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> they didn't?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And they do, at school
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> no
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 😬 i can see why you think ruining someone's life is the next best thing
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Then you are a special case
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:45 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> >.>
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:26:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> if they don't teach you basic first aid
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> When I said it's game over kyra, I meant that people choose w.e they want just because they want to work.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They aren't passionate about what they want to do.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I have learnt a lot of first aids stuff, traffic rules and so on, a lot of things to keep myself alive in the street and help other people in certain cases
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That, at school
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> They just want to earn some money in any way possible.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> you must live in a rather desperate area it seems
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:27:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I had these lessons every year during my primary school, each year more detailed
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:28:24 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> well, I thought that it's how the world works? I did hear that it's the same case in other places also.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:28:40 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> "i hear" well now you hear that it's not
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:29:02 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Okay then.

Wed Aug 30 2017 21:29:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I mean, I went through 2 master courses at university and quit after seeing how shitty the educators are. Not like they weren't in my previous experience.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:30:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> at one university
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:30:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there's like thousands of universities across the world
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:30:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well, my father teaches at many universities at his life time.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:30:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> there's thousands
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:30:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> upon thousands
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:31:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> 1 asshole vs millions of other educators
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:31:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I don't know, I just think that if you don't pay some serious money you won't get a chance to get a good educator if any.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:31:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Most educators that I encountered weren't good.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:31:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> of course you will have to pay
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:31:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> nothing good comes free
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:32:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> And the sad thing that the students don't care.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:32:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> (unless it's Argentina, University is free there)
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:32:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well yeah there are exceptions
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:00 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> If an educator who teachs *master degree* course goes and spout 5 wrong statements while reviewing the final exam, it would go unnoticed.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> but most good unis will be paid
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And surprisingly Argentinian universities have a nice position in the global rankings <:rethonk:349199323218837504>
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> it wouldn't yasser
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> that wouldn't pass
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:30 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It happened to me, and no body even noticed.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> what kind of shitty uni is it
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> anywhere else it simply wouldn't happen in the first place
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:33:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> The one Yasser went
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:34:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:34:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> because competent people would work there
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:34:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's a uni that you get so many bad educators. I encountered one guy who blamed me for not noticing his mistake sooner 😆
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:34:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> and one guy who always come at least 15-30 minutes late to lecutre.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:34:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> so you are going to say all unis are bad because yours happens to be one of the worst
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:34:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I thought education in Spain was very bad, until I'm reading all this from whatever id Yasser's country
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:35:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Although at school it was another story. In university the students got the power here.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:35:45 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That doesn't happen here in Spain
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:35:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> At school teachers go and harm students mentally without a second though.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:35:59 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> <:blobthonkang:293808597522055168>
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:36:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It was quite hell.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:36:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> well then
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:36:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> anyway, i gottaa sleep
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:36:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You want to hear the funniest thing ever though?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:36:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> In Spain, the Professor has the power, and he helps and teach us to pass their exams
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:37:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> There was one educator at university who did a descent job and gave fair grades to students who got punished by the authorities because he didn't give the students extra grades.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:37:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> The students were like *he got what he deserves*.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:37:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> That was it for me.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:37:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> The exam is pretty close and we have doubts? *Professor, can we have a lesson at afternoon soon before the exam? My classmates have a lot of doubts*
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:38:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And they usually agree, 2 hour lesson at the afternoon and done, all doubts resolved
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:38:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That was in Physics&Technology, Algebra and Calculus, in my previous university
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:38:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> We asked, they did that favor to us and helped us a lot
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:09 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Because their role as professors is to teach us
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:13 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Not to be assholes
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> How much do you pay?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> 1000€
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:46 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I'm going to another to study Development of Videogames
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:52 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> 1520€ this one
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:39:57 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> (yearly)
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:40:01 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Sounds fun <:FatThunk:325807830487531522>
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:40:04 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> how many years?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:40:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> 4
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:40:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Also
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:40:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You are still gonna make your own startup with your friend, right?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:41:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Remind me to draw the damn schemas before trying to make things with 2D matrices next time
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:41:37 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Oh, he's holding it more
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:41:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> We had planned to use Source 2...
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:41:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And it didn't get released
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:42:03 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> source 2?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:42:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Yeah
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:42:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> The game engine by Valve
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:42:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> why use that?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:42:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Because it performs very well
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:42:53 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Is multiplatform, and so on
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:43:20 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> As well as no shit involved in the incoming (like in Unreal Engine 4)
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:43:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And Unity... that thing uses C#, C# logic is ewwww to me
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:44:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Other option is using Godot
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:44:18 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Well if you want to make stuff fast then these are the way to go.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:44:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> But godotscript or whatever it's called looks similar to Python
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:44:43 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> thought it's a pretty good engine, opensource, free, and works with Blender
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:44:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> you want an engine that uses js?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:45:06 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I'm not that dickhead
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:45:12 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> C++ only
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:45:22 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> It's just that you uses js a lot since of your bot.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:45:27 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I just thought that you liked js.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:45:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> We're talking about game performance
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:45:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Not oddly beautiful prototype-based OOP code
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:46:08 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That performance is only achievable in C++
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:46:16 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You got some background in C++?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:46:26 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Unless you make the game from scratch with Löve2D
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:46:42 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Which is surprisingly fast
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:46:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Eh, I still have two books to read
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:47:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I do, but very very little
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:48:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> What books are you reading?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:48:48 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> The one about C, 270 pages
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:48:56 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> And C++, 1270 pages or so
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:49:17 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> from <#339438840676745227>
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:49:21 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> is it for the creator of C++?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:49:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Yea
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:49:34 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> That book is very handy to me
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:49:47 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I think that there's a better book for C++ though.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:49:50 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Because I'm very probably to use C++ at University
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:50:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I didn't like the flow of the originator.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:50:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> So yeah, why not master the language before I learn it from there?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:50:33 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Wait, I got a handy thing for you,
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:50:35 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:50:54 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> https://github.com/miloyip/game-programmer?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ZEEF&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fgame-development.zeef.com%2Fdavid.arcila
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:50:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> check the C++ path
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:51:05 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> it's preferable to go with C++ primer.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:51:10 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> I am reading it myself right now.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:52:32 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Jesus Christ
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:52:38 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Too many books about C++
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:52:51 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> You don't have to read all of em. They are for good practices.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:55:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Anyways
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:55:25 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I got my Connect-Four game to work
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:55:55 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Damn the maths, if I had drawn the schema before it wouldn't have taken 7 hours
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:56:15 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> Sounds fun.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:56:19 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Yep
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:56:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Wanna try it?
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:56:29 GMT+0100 (IST) <@244120586299637760> At least you get to learn something from that mistake.
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:57:23 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I mean
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:57:39 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> I just had a "little" issue with the diagonal checking
Wed Aug 30 2017 21:58:36 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> Then fixing a lot issues with the points starting in the coordinates they shouldn't, and so on
Thu Aug 31 2017 07:47:58 GMT+0100 (IST) <@212675363799564289> `That performance is only achievable in C++` oh kyra 😬
Thu Aug 31 2017 09:28:31 GMT+0100 (IST) <@242043489611808769> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
